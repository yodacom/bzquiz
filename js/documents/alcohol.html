<h2>Alcohol Content in Beer</h2>
<p>Beer ranges from less than 3% alcohol by volume (abv) to around 14% abv. The alcohol content of beer varies by local practice or beer style. The pale lagers that most consumers are familiar with fall in the range of 4â€“6%, with a typical abv of 5%. The customary strength of British ales is quite low, with many session beers being around 4% abv. </p>

<p>The alcohol in beer comes primarily from the metabolism of sugars that are produced during fermentation. The quantity of fermentable sugars in the wort and the variety of yeast used to ferment the wort are the primary factors that determine the amount of alcohol in the final beer. Additional fermentable sugars are sometimes added to increase alcohol content, and enzymes are often added to the wort for certain styles of beer (primarily "light" beers) to convert more complex carbohydrates (starches) to fermentable sugars. Alcohol is a by-product of yeast metabolism and is toxic to the yeast;typical brewing yeast cannot survive at alcohol concentrations above 12% by volume. Low temperatures and too little fermentation time decreases the effectiveness of yeasts and consequently decreases the alcohol content.</p>

<p>Your choice here is to estimate by taste the alcohol content as either LOW, AVERAGE, or HIGH.  Don't be discouraged if you cannot discern this attribute at first. It is not simple to taste alcohol content but this taste can be refined with practice. So just guess your beer by tasting and compare with other beers using this app and get a sense of it over time.  </p>

<h3>HOW TO RATE (ABV=Alcohol by Volume):</h3>
<h4>'LOW' = ABV below 4%.  </h4>
<h4>'AVERAGE' = ABV between 4% and 7%.  </h4>
<h4>'HIGH' = ABV as anything above 7%.</h4>
