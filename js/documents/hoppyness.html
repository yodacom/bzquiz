We may be a long way from being able to express that in a simple number, but we need to at least be thinking of it in these terms.</q><cite style="margin:0 0 0 15">Jeff Alworth.

 <p>Our beer tasting has become more refined in the last couple of decades. In the past beer hoppyness has been equated with Bitterness levels as measured by the IBU scale.  But that view is rapidly changing.  Breweries are shifting their processes to wring more flavor and aroma out of the hop.  In the past breweries would stew the hops in boiling water and this in turn would cause them to lose most of their flavor and aroma compounds which come from delicate and volatile essential oils in them.  Nowadays breweries are instead starting to put most of the hops in at the end of the boil to make sure they are capturing more of the aroma and flavor.  Some will even use massive "post boil" use of hops to go into the wort after it's taken off the flame. Kinda like steeping tea the wort becomes infused with those oils and terpenes and other aromas to develop that intense flavor we now associate with IPA beers.</p>

<p>Now it is possible to have an extreamly biter beer that has almost no aroma and little hop flavor or have a beer packed with flavor and aroma but not very bitter at all.  Hence the challange we now face linking bitterness scale to "hoppyness".  Hoppyness is more a measure of Flavor and Aroma than just bitterness (IBU's') alone. </p>

<p>So our simple BeerZap scale, untill we get a more objective measure, will be:</p>

<h3>STRONG - A clear and strong distictive flavor and aroma</h3>
<h3>MEDIUM - Taste and aroma is present but not overt nor especially distictive .</h3>
<h3>MILD - Aroma and Flavor is not distictive, does not stand out, but may be present.</h3>

<p>Make your best guess and we will compare that with what others seem to think the Hoppyness is of that beer as we collect more data on this attribute of beer.</p>

<p>We will start recording peoples ratings and look at the data relative to bitterness IBU scale, and see what that reveals over time.  Stay tuned.</p>
