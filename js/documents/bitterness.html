<h2>Bitterness Rating</h2>
<p>Tasteing to rate bitterness is an attempt to rate the perceived relative bitterness of beer and descibe it to others. Bitterness of a beer is provided by compounds such as humulones, or alpha acids from hops used during brewing. During the brewing process, humulone undergoes isomerization to form both cis- and trans- isohumulone which are responsible for the bitter taste of the beer.</P>

<p>Likewise, hops contain lupulones, or beta acids. Beta acids can undergo oxidation and slowly contribute to the bitterness of the beer. This bitterness is harsher than the bitterness of the alpha acids and this flavor can be undesirable. The oxidation occurs over time through fermentation, storage, and aging.</p>

<p>Since the quantities of alpha and beta acids range among hops, the variety of hop is considered when targeting a specific amount of bitterness in the beer. To maximize bitterness, hops with large alpha acid concentrations are used. Such varieties include Chinook, Galena, Horizon, Tomahawk, and Warrior hops. These contain alpha acid concentrations up to 16% by mass. The amount of time that the hops are boiled also impacts the bitterness of a beer.</p>

<p>The International Bittering Units scale, or simply IBU scale, is chemical measurement tool used to approximate and quantify the bitterness of beer. </p>

<p>Because IBU isn't determined by the "perceived" bitterness of the taste of the beer, but is instead a chemical measurement of bitterness, it is difficult to use as a match our own percived taste of bitterness. Nevertheless, as BeerZap tasters we want to be able to recomend and rate our beer's bitterness by taste so we can recomend it to others who we know prefer more or less bitterness in their beer. </p>

<p>Why IBU can be a tricky measure for our own taste of bitterness is, for example, that the bittering effect of hops is less noticeable in beers with roasted malts or strong flavours, so a higher proportion of hops would be required in strong flavoured beers to achieve the same perceived bitterness in moderately flavoured beers. So an imperial stout may have an IBU of 50,but will taste less bitter than a pale lager with an IBU of 30, because the pale lager has a lower flavour intensity. Light lagers without much bitterness will generally have 8-20 IBU, while an India pale ale may have 60-100 IBU or more.  </p>

<p>Since IBU is really the only "objective" measure we have for bitterness, we will use it for the tasting/quiz using the following scale as a measure:</p>

<h3>BZ RATING SCALE:</h3>
<h4>LOW: 4-20 IBU</h4>
<h4>MEDIUM: 20-60 IBU</h4>
<h4>STRONG: OVER 60 IBU</h4>

<p>Just go ahead and rate this beer with your own sense of bitterness taste using one of these three categories - just as if you were describing it to others.  We will provide the IBU rating to you, after you choose, to help you get a sense of how your taste correlates to the IBU numberic chemical rating measures. </p>
