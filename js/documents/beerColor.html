<h2>Beer Color</h2>

<p>There’s a lot that goes into brewing a beer. Water, hops, malted grain, and yeast work together to create your favorite bottled beverage. Ultimatly the the most significant determinant of color is the malted grain. The chemical reactions that occur in malted barley give beer the color you see. </p>

<p>There are two chemical reactions that most influence beer color: The Maillard Reaction and Caramelization. The Maillard Reaction is like when you sear meat, toast bread or roast a marshmellow. The Maillard Reaction is a chemical reaction that occurs between amino acids and reducing sugars. In beer,The Maillard Reaction happens when you kiln malted barley. This process produces chocolate malt and black patent malt. You can expect chocolate, toasted or coffee notes and a darker color from darker malts like these.</p>

<p>Caramelization also contributes to a beer’s color. This reaction occurs when you heat the sugar during a boil until it decomposes by itself. Longer boils means darker beer. Darker colors show that caramelization process and create a caramel, buttery, or toffee like flavor.</p>
